Instructions:-

Press any key to start the game. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly.

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
